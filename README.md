# Analysis of Reusable Wind Turbine Blades: Staying Ahead of Renewable Energy Curve

## Project Objective
New York state has been increasingly siting wind farms across the state and most recently has approved sites closer to the New York City area, as part of its expanding renewable energy strategy. Wind turbine blades are often decommissioned  before the end of usefule life due to material and other technological advance to increase efficieny.

Decommisioned blades need to go somewhere; either they are recovered and reused in other applications, or they are landfilled. This project will:

1. Assess the future of recovery and direct reuse of decommisioned turbine blades in New York to keep them out of landfills
2. Develop a plan to support future reuse of decommisioned wind turbine blades
3. Design a geographical model to minimize GHG emissions for the reuse plan.
